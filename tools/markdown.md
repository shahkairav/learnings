Hyperlinks: [this is how you link google](https://www.google.com/).

To **embolden text**, use two asterisks on both sides.

To _italicize text_, use underscore on both sides.

To `emphasize` a word, use backtick on both sides.

A code snippet can be added by three backticks at the start and end. Mention the language after the 3 ticks at the beginning for syntax highlighting.
``` c++
int main() {
    cout << "Hello world" << endl;
    return 0;
}
``` 

> To create a note/warning, use ">".

Add bullet points using hyphens. For example:
- apples
- bananas

Numbered lists can be created by using numbers themselves followed by either a `.` or `)`. For example:
1. apples
2. bananas
