Rows are often referred to as `records` and columns as `fields`.

Each set of rows and columns is called a `table`. These tables interact with each another to create a **relational database**.

The structure of tables in a database is called **the schema**.

A database:
* provides structure to data
* allows enforcement of rules on data
* protects data from unauthorized access or changes
