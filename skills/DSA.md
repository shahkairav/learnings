# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Some common question patterns
1. 2 pointer approach
    - Mostly used for linked list and arrays
    - Most of the time the same problem can be solved using hashing.
    - 2 pointers provides better space complexity as compared to hashing
    - General use case: Find a pair with specific property
    - Ex: 
        1. Find pair whose sum is closest to X
        2. Find triplets with zero sum
        3. Detecting loop in a linked list
        4. Finding head of the cycle in a linked list
        5. Finding Kth last element in a array
